# ip-web

This is my React website, using prismic CMS and Netlify for hosting. I have also created a provider that tracks user page visits, IP addresses, country etc. This is posted to the `get-ip` service, and fed to the `admin` UI.

# Setup
- Run `yarn` to install dependencies
- Run `yarn vite` to start up the interface
